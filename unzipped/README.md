# shtirllitz plugin for notepad++

## this is old version left for the compatibility, use dlls from folders 32bit and 64bit

ShtirlitzNppPlugin.dll requires files:
  * Shtirlitz\Shtirlitz.cfg
  * Shtirlitz\Shtirlitz.dat
  
They define encodings and options to be used.

Shtirlitz\Shtirlitz.exe can be used to manage these files, and it requires Shtirlitz.loc for localized strings.
